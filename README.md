# ik_llama.cpp Build Recipe

Build scripts for [`ik_llama.cpp`](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp), compiled for exactly one machine: this one. Out the other end come an Arch package and two Docker images, all from a single upstream clone.

Nothing here is portable, and that is the entire point. If you want binaries that run anywhere, upstream ships those and they are lovely. These are not those.

## Targets

Two hard constraints are baked in. They are constraints, not achievements:

| | Target | Consequence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **CPU** | `znver5` (Zen 5) | `SIGILL` on anything older. Not "slower" — *dead*. |
| **GPU** | CUDA SM `86` / `89` / `90` (Ampere, Ada, Hopper) | No kernels for your Pascal card. It will not fall back. It will simply not work. |

Note that "Zen 5" is an **architecture**, not a shopping list. Any Zen 5 part will do. The binary neither knows nor cares which one you bought, and `-march=znver5` has never once been impressed by a model number.

## What the flags actually buy you

The build turns on `-O3 -march=znver5 -mtune=znver5`, the full AVX-512 spread (`VBMI`, `VNNI`, `BF16`), and LTO. All of it applies to **both** image variants — the CPU image is exactly as architecture-locked as the CUDA one, just smaller and worse at matrix multiplication.

Now the part every other README leaves out: **this is worth a few percent, and only in the right places.**

Token generation on CPU is memory-bandwidth-bound. Your cores spend most of their day waiting on RAM, and a compiler flag has no opinion about DDR5 latency. Prompt processing is compute-bound and genuinely enjoys AVX-512, so you will see it there. Everything else is rounding error.

So: real gains, narrow scope, no magic. Compiling `-march=native` has never rescued a machine from its own memory subsystem, and it will not start today. Zen 5 is a perfectly nice place to be — this just declines to leave anything on the table while you are there.

## Building

`just` is the front door. There are two variants, cut from one `Dockerfile` by a `VARIANT` build arg:

| Tag | Runtime base | Unpacked / pull |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `:cuda` | `nvidia/cuda:13.3.0-runtime-ubuntu24.04` | 4.03 GB / 2.94 GB |
| `:cpu` | `ubuntu:24.04` | 0.17 GB / 0.06 GB |

```bash
just            # list recipes
just check      # has upstream moved since each image was built?
just cpu        # build ghcr.io/delfianto/ik_llama.cpp-zen5:cpu
just cuda       # build ghcr.io/delfianto/ik_llama.cpp-zen5:cuda
just all        # both
just pkg        # the Arch package, via makepkg
```

BuildKit only builds stages the chosen variant can actually reach, so `just cpu` never drags down the CUDA base images. The 24x size gap between the two is almost entirely NVIDIA's runtime plus **1.37 GB of statically-linked device code** — of which `llama-cli` is a ~678 MB near-duplicate of `llama-server`, carried purely so you can poke at things inside the container. Worth it, probably. Nobody has ever checked.

> `docker images` will insist these are 6.97 GB and 231 MB. It is lying — or rather, containerd's image store is counting the compressed blobs *and* the unpacked snapshots and adding them together, which is a bold interpretation of the word "size". The table above is real.

### There is no CI, and that is deliberate

A Zen 5 + LTO + CUDA build on a shared GitHub runner took the better part of forever and produced binaries **the runner itself could not execute**. Paying a stranger's CPU to emit instructions it cannot run, slowly, is a form of performance art this repository has retired. Everything builds on the machine that runs it. A cold `:cuda` build is ~20–25 minutes, and the LTO link is most of the tail.

### One clone, shared with makepkg

`./ik_llama.cpp` is a bare mirror of upstream and the single source of truth. It is the same clone `makepkg` populates from the PKGBUILD's `source=git+...`, so `just pkg` and the Docker builds do not each go fetch their own copy like roommates buying separate milk.

Each build runs `git archive <sha>` from that mirror into `.build/src`, handed to the `Dockerfile` as a named context. No network, no re-clone, no `.git` in the image. `git archive` is byte-deterministic — mtimes come from the commit — so an unchanged commit re-extracts identically and the `COPY` layer still cache-hits.

Because the source arrives as a named context, a bare `docker build .` no longer works. Use `just`.

### Tracking upstream

Every image records its commit as an `org.opencontainers.image.revision` label, so it is self-describing and there is no stamp file waiting to quietly desynchronize. `just check` fetches the mirror and diffs upstream against that label:

```console
$ just check
upstream main @ 1fddd12ba861  (18 hours ago -- New op: ggml_sum_rows_ext (#2132))

  cpu:  up to date
  cuda: STALE at bbc7de47c1a2 (37 commits behind)
```

Builds skip themselves when the image already matches upstream. Override with `FORCE=1`, or pin a ref (branch, tag, or full SHA):

```bash
FORCE=1 just cuda
IK_LLAMA_REF=bbc7de47 just cuda
```

`ccache` is mounted per variant, so bumping upstream a few commits recompiles a small slice rather than the whole tree. The LTO link still runs in full every time, because LTO is like that.

### Publishing

Images are tagged into `ghcr.io/delfianto` but nothing pushes on its own:

```bash
docker push ghcr.io/delfianto/ik_llama.cpp-zen5:cuda
```

There is no `:latest`. With two variants it would have to mean one of them, and whichever it meant would be wrong half the time.

## Running it (OpenWebUI sidecar)

Drop-in for any OpenAI-compatible backend. The entrypoint reads:

| Variable | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MODEL_PATH` | — | Required. |
| `MTP_MODEL_PATH` | unset | Enables `--spec-draft-model` + `--spec-type draft-mtp`. |
| `MTP_DRAFT_N` | `2` | Lookahead depth for the above. |
| `CTX_SIZE` | `8192` | |
| `N_GPU_LAYERS` | `-1` | Ignored by `:cpu`, which has no GPU to offload to. |
| `THREADS` | `nproc` | |
| `HOST` / `PORT` | `0.0.0.0` / `8080` | |
| `EXTRA_ARGS` | unset | Passed through verbatim, word-split, no quoting. Be nice. |

```yaml
services:
  llama-server-sidecar:
    image: ghcr.io/delfianto/ik_llama.cpp-zen5:cuda
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - ./models:/models
    environment:
      - MODEL_PATH=/models/gemma-4-main-qat.gguf
      - MTP_MODEL_PATH=/models/gemma-4-draft-mtp.gguf
      - CTX_SIZE=8192
      - N_GPU_LAYERS=-1
    deploy:
      resources:
        reservations:
          devices:
            - driver: nvidia
              count: 1
              capabilities: [gpu]
```

For `:cpu`, same block minus the `deploy:` section. See `docker-compose.example.yml` for a full stack with OpenWebUI.

One trap worth naming: on `:cuda` the weights live in VRAM, so the container's RAM footprint is small and a tight memory limit looks fine. Move that same model to `:cpu` and the weights land in host RAM — with `--mlock`, permanently — and the limit you never thought about becomes an OOM kill at load. Size it for the model, not for what the GPU was politely hiding from you.

## Arch package

```bash
just pkg      # or: makepkg -si
```

Shares the mirror above, so it will not re-clone. Same architecture constraints apply, which is to say: it will not run on your laptop, your NAS, or that Xeon you were emotionally attached to in 2019.
