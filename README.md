# ik_llama.cpp-zen5

This repository provides a bleeding-edge, highly specialized build configuration for `ik_llama.cpp` (a fork of `llama.cpp`), specifically optimized for **AMD Ryzen 9 9950X (Zen 5)** processors and modern **NVIDIA GPUs (RTX 30 series and higher)**.

It serves dual purposes:
1. **Arch Linux Package**: A dynamically versioned PKGBUILD for native host installation.
2. **Docker Sidecar**: A hyper-optimized container image designed to run as an OpenWebUI sidecar backend.

Both artifacts are built automatically every day at midnight (UTC) via GitHub Actions, pulling the absolute latest commits from the upstream `ik_llama.cpp` repository.

## 🚀 Extreme Optimizations

- **Modern GPU Targeting**: Compiles CUDA binaries strictly for `86;89;90` architectures (Ampere, Ada Lovelace, Hopper), reducing binary bloat and stripping out legacy Pascal/Turing support.
- **Aggressive CPU Tuning**: Forcibly overrides compiler flags with `-O3 -march=znver5 -mtune=znver5` to take absolute advantage of the Zen 5 pipeline during cross-compilation.
- **AVX-512 Domination**: Fully utilizes Zen 5's native 512-bit wide data paths with enabled `AVX512`, `VBMI`, `VNNI`, and `BF16` extensions.
- **LTO**: Link-Time Optimization is enabled for maximal cross-module tuning.

## 🐳 Docker Sidecar (OpenWebUI)

The Docker image (`ghcr.io/delfianto/ik_llama.cpp-zen5:latest`) is built on top of `nvidia/cuda:12.6.0-runtime-ubuntu24.04` and acts as a drop-in replacement for any OpenAI-compatible backend. 

### Advanced Features (MTP & QAT)
The container's dynamic entrypoint supports **Quantization Aware Training (QAT)** natively and handles **Multi-Token Prediction (MTP)** speculative decoding automatically (ideal for models like **Gemma 4**). 

If you pass an MTP draft model via the `MTP_MODEL_PATH` environment variable, the entrypoint will automatically hook the `--spec-draft-model` and `--spec-type draft-mtp` flags into the backend engine to accelerate generation.

## 📦 Arch Linux Package Usage

If you prefer running it directly on your Arch host rather than via Docker, simply grab the latest `.pkg.tar.zst` from the **GitHub Actions Artifacts** page and install it locally:

```bash
sudo pacman -U ik-llama.cpp-zen5-git-*.pkg.tar.zst
```

*Note: Because this is hardcoded for `znver5` and RTX 30+, it will likely core dump or fail to execute if you attempt to run it on older hardware.*
